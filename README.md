# Speech-Emotion-Analyzer
The idea behind creating this project was to build a machine learning model that could detect emotions from the speech we have with each other all the time. Nowadays personalization is something that is needed in all the things we experience everyday.  So why not have a emotion detector that will guage your emotions and in the future recommend you different things based on your mood. This can be used by multiple industries to offer different services like marketing company suggesting you to buy products based on your emotions, automotive industry can detect the persons emotions and adjust the speed of autonomous cars as required to avoid any collisions etc.
